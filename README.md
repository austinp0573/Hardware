# Hardware Projects

This repository contains a collection of open-source hardware designs by **Austin P**, focused on practical, reproducible, and well-documented embedded systems.

Each subfolder includes a complete hardware project, featuring:
- Schematic and PCB layout files (e.g. EasyEDA Pro)
- 3D views and reference images
- Bill of materials (BOM)
- Gerber files for fabrication
- Project-specific documentation and licensing

All designs are released under open hardware licenses for educational and development use.  
These projects reflect my interests in embedded systems, PCB design, and hardware/software integration.

## Featured Project

### 🔹 [Quectel LC86G-PA Breakout V2.1](./Quectel-LC86G-Breakout-V2.1)
A compact GNSS breakout board designed for integration with microcontrollers.  
Includes backup battery circuitry, filtered power input, UART/I2C headers, and ESD protection.
